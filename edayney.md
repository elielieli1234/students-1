My name is Elijah Dayney, and I like web development. I don't really have much experience but currently I'm trying to learn some Node APIs, and I plan on learning some system design to better understand the browser for backend server and authentication frameworks. My only experience has been through a club here at school but I'm hoping to build some personal projects that can leverage me into an industry role.
